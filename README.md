Weather API
You are to build out a weather app.

The weather app will be made where you are able to do the following:

Be able to search for a location to get the weather for

Add that city to a list of favorites

On each search, I need the ability to see the following (how you achieve this is up to you)

Current weather at the time I do the search

A general 5 day forecast

The ability to see max temp and min temp of the current day.

Desktop only build
